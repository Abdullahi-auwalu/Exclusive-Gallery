# Exclusive Gallery App

The Exclusive Gallery App is a web application that allows users to manage and view a collection of images. Users can add new images, search for images by number tag, and rearrange the order of images. The app is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Add Images**: Users can add new images to the gallery by either dragging and dropping images onto the app or by clicking to select files.

- **Search by Number Tag**: Users can search for images by entering a number tag in the search bar. The app will display images with matching number tags.

- **Rearrange Images**: Users can rearrange the order of images by dragging and dropping them within the gallery. Note that only the order of added images can be rearranged.

- **Delete Images**: Users can delete images from the gallery by clicking the "Delete" button on each image card.

## How to Use

1. **Adding Images**:
   - To add images, simply drag and drop image files onto the app's dropzone area.
   - Alternatively, you can click the dropzone area to open a file dialog and select image files to upload.

2. **Searching for Images**:
   - Enter a number tag in the search bar and click the "Search" button to filter images by the specified number tag.
   - To reset the search and display all images, clear the search bar and click "Search."

3. **Rearranging Images**:
   - To rearrange the order of images, click and drag an image card to the desired position within the gallery.

4. **Deleting Images**:
   - To delete an image, click the "Delete" button on the image card. This action is irreversible.

## Note

- Only the order of added images can be rearranged. The app does not support rearranging images by their number tag or other attributes.

- Images are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, so they will persist across sessions unless the browser cache is cleared.

- The app is designed to be a simple image gallery management tool. For more advanced features or image editing capabilities, consider using dedicated image management software.
